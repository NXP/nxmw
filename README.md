# NX Middleware for EdgeLock A30 and NTAG-X-DNA Secure Authenticator

EdgeLock A30 and NTAG-X-DNA are secure authentication ICs for IoT platforms, electronic accessories and consumable devices
such as home electronic devices, mobile accessories and medical supplies.
EdgeLock A30 and NTAG-X-DNA supports on-chip ECC key generation to make sure that private keys are never exposed outside
the IC. It performs cryptographic operations for security critical communication and control functions. EdgeLock A30 and NTAG-X-DNA are
Common Criteria EAL 6+ security certified with AVA_VAN.5 on product level and supports a generic

Crypto API providing AES, ECDSA, ECDH, SHA, HMAC and HKDF cryptographic functionality.
- Asymmetric cryptography features support 256-bit ECC over the NIST P-256 and brainpool P256r1 curves.
- Symmetric cryptography features support both AES-128 and AES-256.
- PKI-based mutual authentication based on the Sigma-I protocol.
- Symmetric three pass Mutual Authentication protocol compatible with NTAG42x and MIFARE DesFire EV2, DesFire EV3 and DesFire Light.
- Secure messaging channel using either AES-128 or AES-256 session encryption/decryption and MAC.

The Common Criteria security certification ensures that the IC security measures and protection mechanisms
have been evaluated against sophisticated noninvasive and invasive attack scenarios.
- A30 supports an I2C contact interface and has two additional 2 GPIOs.
- A30 supports a low-power design, and consumes only 5 Î¼A at Deep-Power-Down mode when an external VDD is supplied.


NX Middleware here provides the necessary interfaces, examples, demos for A30 Secure Authenticator (SA) IC.

NOTE:
  1) It is recommended to use the latest version of this NX middleware software.
  2) VCOM and PC/SC interfaces (https://pcscworkgroup.com/) are provided for quick evaluation of the Secure authenticator examples and should not be deployed in a product.
