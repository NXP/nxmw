## About The MCUX Projects

Demos for the supported boards are provided in respective MCUX folders. Every project contains MCUXpresso supported projects which can be used to build and debug the demos. The project folder contains the feature file `fsl_sss_ftr.h` with the necessary configurations for building the project.

For more information on the configurations (Refer: [**SA Configs**](../doc/config/README.md)).

For building and running the projects, refer [**Getting Started on MCUs Using Standalone MCUXpresso Projects**](../doc/mcu_projects/readme.md).
